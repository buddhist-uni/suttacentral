              <p>Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations, and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started creating and publishing our own translations of these seminal spiritual classics. The “Editions” series now makes selected translations available as books in various formats, including print, PDF, and EPUB.</p>
              <p>Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and reliable translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with every detail of the production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in every way. These are the core scriptures underlying the entire Buddhist tradition, and we believe that they deserve to be preserved and made available in highest quality without compromise.</p>

              The Long Discourses (Dīgha Nikāya, abbreviated DN) is a collection of 34 discourses in
              in the Pali canon (Tipiṭaka) of the Theravāda school. The word “long” refers to the
              length of the individual discourses, not the collection as a whole, which is in fact
              the smallest of the five Pali Nikāyas. It is one of the fundamental collections of
              early Buddhist teachings, depicting the Buddha in a lively range of settings. Many of
              its extended narratives in diverse literary styles feature interreligious dialog with
              brahmins and other non-Buddhists.

              The Middle Discourses (Majjhima Nikāya) is a collection of 152 discourses in the Pali
              Pali canon (Tipiṭaka) that are of “middle” length. It is perhaps the most popular
              collection of early discourses, its teachings ranging from practical morality for
              children to challenging and abstruse philosophy. These teachings emerge as the Buddha
              encounters people from all walks of life in ancient India. More than any other
              collection, it reveals the full range of the Buddha in inspiration and wonder, in
              closely reasoned argumentation, and in deep abiding compassion.
