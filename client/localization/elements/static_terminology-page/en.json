In this sense it is used of the monastic code (_pātimokkha_), too. After the Buddha’s death the suttas were originally passed down in oral tradition.

    "terminology:390": "Tathāgata",
    "terminology:391": "The “Realized One”, a frequent epithet for the Buddha, although occasionally it also denotes any of his arahant disciples.

It was also applied to the growing set of rules and procedures governing monastic discipline, and that meaning grew to become the dominant one in later years.
